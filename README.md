# Building History Viewer

The **Building History Viewer** is a web tool that allows users to explore the historical information of a building. By entering the building number, street name, city, and country, users can retrieve and view the history associated with the specified building.
It works well with building that are used by a lot of different people, like shops and restaurants. It is not as useful for buildings that are used by a single person, like houses.
